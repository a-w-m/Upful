# Description
- Upful is a minimalist E-commerce boutique built using Gatsby, Snipcart, Netlify, and Netlify CMS. 

# Technology
- I wrote Upful using React typescript. I use Netlify CMS to create the data, Gatsby to query the data and generate pages, Snipcart to handle cart integration, and Netlify to deploy the application and handle serverless functions.
