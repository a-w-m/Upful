# Description
Upful is a minimalist boutique built using Gatsby, Snipcart, Netlify, and Netlify CMS. 

Leveraging a headless CMS, continuous integration, serverless functions, and Snipcart, I developed an online storefront that allows non-developers to add new pages, content, and products. Behind the scenes, I used Gatsby's graphql API to query content and generate static pages. I composed unit-tested React UI components written in TypeScript and maintained consistent application state using React hooks.
