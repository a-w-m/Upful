From our dear friends Emily & Merritt at The Great - The Ruffled Melody Top.Â 

This lightweight shirt has beautiful voluminous sleeves that gather at the wrist with a delicate ruffle, and an easy body we love buttoning up and tucking into high waisted bottoms for a polished look, or leaving a few buttons undone and front tucking for a more effortless look.

*Model is 5'7" wearing size 1*

*Size 1 - Overall Length: 24 5/8", Chest: 48", Sleeve Length: 17"*
