Jungmaven grew from roots of simplicity and sustainability. With a focus of raising awareness about the many uses of hemp, they see fashion as a form of activism: what we choose to wear says both who we are and what we stand for. Choosing a hemp tee is a small, simple act – but it’s one that can change the world. Hemp’s potential to mitigate climate change is one of the greatest opportunities of our generation.
