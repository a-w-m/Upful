Artisan dolls inspired by the Waldorf aesthetic. The dolls are simple in form, made with a cotton blend velour and filled with locally produced wool. Pocket Mama features baby nestled in her front pocket.

Each piece is designed and produced by hand in small run batches by dollmaker Tania Prosser in her home studio in Sonoma, CA.

Sold individually.
