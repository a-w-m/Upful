description: "This gorgeous basket handbag is structured with a flat bottom so it stands on its own grabbing attention wherever you set it! An elevated casual style that transitions from day to night.

This bag is handwoven in the village of Tenganan, Bali using natural Ata reed. Then skilled artisans intricately weave the reed strands into baskets, working on one basket for up to a month. Once fully woven, the baskets are boiled and left in the sun to dry for a week. Finally, to strengthen the weave, condition the fibers, and leave a natural finish, baskets are smoked over coconut shell clippings. A true dedication to craft to make these gorgeous bags."
